Record:
		Today I worked or studied in the 30th team in HUST's engineering practise training. 
		The task of the training is to set up a java web project, and now we are woking on the SQL table.
		I'm the first to join a team to start a project and now I feel confused on how to do next, and what's the use of what I did.
		I dont want to let my partner down.
	
Plan:
		1.Understand the whole architecture of the java web project, figure out what we had done and what is left.
		2.Learn the rest of the project. Maybe they are JSP, JDBC, servlet.
		3.Find my English notebook and take notes when reading English novels and playing games.
		4.Run in the evening, when running I can practice the memory palace.If it rains, use the dumbbell and yoga mat.
