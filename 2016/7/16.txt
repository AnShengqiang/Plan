Record:
		A week past since the beginning of summer holiday. I have finished 2 books--one about Android and another about drawing.
And I am studying another 2 books now! They are about Android and guitar. But in the last 3 days, my daily routine has been 
messed up. So I decided to write something to fix it up.

Plan:
		1.Code according the Android book. I must speed up, I need achievement.
		2.Draw at dawn.
		3.Play guitar at 19:00-21:00.
